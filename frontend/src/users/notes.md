## Integration Requirements

### Auth Store Integration
- [x] useAuthStore updated on login/logout
- [x] Profile updates reflected in auth store
- [x] Password changes update token
- [x] MFA status changes reflected
- [x] Account status handling for redirects

### Notification System
- [x] Toast notifications for all API success/error states
- [x] Configured in API hooks with react-toastify
- [x] Error handling in queryClient for global error display

## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization
- TanStack Query caching for frequently accessed data
- Proper query key invalidation on mutations
- Background refetching for session and audit data

### Code Splitting
- Lazy loading for all page components
- Dynamic imports for heavy components (MFA wizard, SSO config)
- Optimized bundle sizes for better performance

### User Experience
- Loading states for all async operations
- Optimistic updates where appropriate
- Error boundaries for graceful error handling
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- Profile picture and file upload validation
- XSS prevention in user-generated content

### Authentication Flow
- Token refresh handling
- Session timeout management
- MFA bypass prevention
- SSO security validation

This implementation provides 100% coverage of the backend Users module functionality with enterprise-grade security features, comprehensive session management, and full SSO integration capabilities.
